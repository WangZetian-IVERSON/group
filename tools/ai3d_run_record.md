Notes:
- Signed COS download URLs were present in `tools/ai3d_last_job.json`; files downloaded locally into the folder above.
- Signed URLs are time-limited — if you need to keep the files long-term, move them to your own storage.
- The repository currently contains some build artifacts from earlier commits; tell me if you want me to add a `.gitignore` and remove unwanted files from the repo.

Next steps you might want:
- Commit the downloaded artifacts (if desired) and the run record to Git.
- Remove any accidentally committed build binaries from Git history (requires careful steps).
- Rotate the Tencent credentials if you are concerned about exposure.
